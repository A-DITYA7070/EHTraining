LOCAL FILE INCLUSION :-

The File Inclusion vulnerability allows an attacker to include a file, usually exploiting a “dynamic file inclusion” mechanisms 
implemented in the target application. The vulnerability occurs due to the use of user-supplied input without proper validation.

This can lead to something as outputting the contents of the file, but depending on the severity, it can also lead to:

i)   Code execution on the web server
ii)  Code execution on the client-side such as JavaScript which can lead to other attacks such as cross site scripting (XSS)
iii) Denial of Service (DoS)
iv)  Sensitive Information Disclosure


Local file inclusion (also known as LFI) is the process of including files, that are already locally present on the server, 
through the exploiting of vulnerable inclusion procedures implemented in the application. This vulnerability occurs, for example, 
when a page receives, as input, the path to the file that has to be included and this input is not properly sanitized, allowing 
directory traversal characters (such as dot-dot-slash) to be injected. Although most examples point to vulnerable PHP scripts, 
we should keep in mind that it is also common in other technologies such as JSP, ASP and others.


How to Test
i)   Since LFI occurs when paths passed to include statements are not properly sanitized, in a blackbox testing approach, we should 
     look for scripts which take filenames as parameters.
     EX :- http://vulnerable_host/preview.php?file=example.html 
           THIS CAN BE EXPLOITED BY 
           http://vulnerable_host/preview.php?file=../../../../etc/passwd

NULL BYTE (%00) :- 
<?php “include/”.include($_GET['filename'].“.php”); ?>
In the case, simple substitution with arbitrary filename would not work as the postfix ‘php’ is appended. In order to bypass it, 
a technique with null-byte terminators is used. Since %00 effectively presents the end of the string, any characters after this 
special byte will be ignored. Thus, the following request will also return an attacker list of basic users attributes:

http://vulnerable_host/preview.php?file=../../../../etc/passwd%00
