A content management system (CMS) is an application that is used to manage content and allow multiple contributors to create, edit, and publish. Content in a CMS is typically stored in a database and displayed in a presentation layer based on a set of templates, such as a web page.

One of the main advantages of CMS is its collaborative nature. Multiple users can log in and contribute, schedule or manage content to be published. Since the interface is usually browser-based, the CMS can be accessed from anywhere by any number of users. The second main advantage of a CMS is that it allows non-technical people who do not know programming languages ​​to easily create and manage their own web content. A typical content management platform's drag-and-drop editors allow users to enter text and upload images without having to know HTML or CSS (programming languages). When a company uses a CMS to publish its website, it reduces its reliance on front-end developers to make changes to the website, making it faster and easier to publish new websites.
