==>  XML := extensible markup language.
==>  XML is a software- and hardware-independent tool for storing and transporting data.

i)   XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language
ii)  XML is a markup language much like HTML
iii) XML was designed to store and transport data
iv)  XML was designed to be self-descriptive

EX :- 
<note>
  <to>Tove</to>
  <from>Jani</from>
  <heading>Reminder</heading>
  <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
</note>

XML is just information wrapped in tags.

The Difference Between XML and HTML
XML and HTML were designed with different goals:

i)   XML was designed to carry data - with focus on what data is
ii)  HTML was designed to display data - with focus on how data looks
iii) XML tags are not predefined like HTML tags are

XML Does Not Use Predefined Tags
The XML language has no predefined tags.
The tags in the example above (like <to> and <from>) are not defined in any XML standard. These tags are "invented" by the author of the XML document
HTML works with predefined tags like <p>, <h1>, <table>, etc.
With XML, the author must define both the tags and the document structure.

XML is Extensible
Most XML applications will work as expected even if new data is added (or removed).
Imagine an application designed to display the original version of note.xml (<to> <from> <heading> <body>).
Then imagine a newer version of note.xml with added <date> and <hour> elements, and a removed <heading>.
The way XML is constructed, older version of the application can still work:
<note>
  <date>2015-09-01</date>
  <hour>08:30</hour>
  <to>Tove</to>
  <from>Jani</from>
  <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>

XML Simplifies Things
XML simplifies data sharing
XML simplifies data transport
XML simplifies platform changes
XML simplifies data availability
Many computer systems contain data in incompatible formats. Exchanging data between incompatible systems (or upgraded systems) is a 
time-consuming task for web developers. Large amounts of data must be converted, and incompatible data is often lost.
XML stores data in plain text format. This provides a software- and hardware-independent way of storing, transporting, and sharing data.
XML also makes it easier to expand or upgrade to new operating systems, new applications, or new browsers, without losing data.
With XML, data can be available to all kinds of "reading machines" like people, computers, voice machines, news feeds, etc.
