Proxy server :- A proxy server acts as a gateway between users and internet. It can be set up as a firewall or web filter, acting as a layer of cyber security that
prevents cyber attacks from entering a private networks.It also protects computer from malwares and other threats.
=> It improves privacy,security and performance.
Tunneling :- Tunneling is a cryptographic network protocol that has multiple uses in networking:
Packet movement
Tunneling can move packets from one network to another by wrapping a packet inside another packet. This is called encapsulation.
Port redirection
Tunneling can redirect network traffic from one port to another. This allows secure access to network traffic and services across 
firewalls and from outside the network.
Data transmission
Tunneling can transmit data across a public network, but the data is intended for use only within a private network.
Remote access
Tunneling can enable remote access users to connect to a variety of network resources through a public data network.
Encrypted data transfer
Tunneling can transfer encrypted data over the network

Tunneling is a way to move packets from one network to another. Tunneling works via encapsulation: wrapping a packet inside another packet.
It is a protocol that allows for the secure envirmoment of data from one network to another.
A technique of internetworking called tunneling is used when src and destination networks of some type are to he connected through a network of diff type.'
EX :- an ethernet to be connected to another ethernet through wan.
IT works by encapsulating packets :- wrapping packets inside packets.
