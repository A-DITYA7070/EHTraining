1) onerror event :- 
  The onerror event is an event handler attribute in HTML and JavaScript that is triggered when an error occurs during the 
  loading of an external resource, such as an image, script, or stylesheet. This event provides a way to handle errors gracefully 
   within your web application.
  The onerror event handler can be attached to various HTML elements that load external resources, such as <img>, 
  <script>, <link>, etc. When an error occurs while loading the specified resource, the function assigned to the onerror
  attribute is executed.
  <img src="image.jpg" onerror="alert('Failed to load image!');">
  The onerror event is particularly useful for gracefully handling situations where external resources may fail to load, providing fallbacks, 
  logging errors, or informing users about the issue. It helps improve the user experience by giving developers the ability to respond to 
  errors in a controlled manner.
