WHAT IS XSS ?
Cross-site scripting (also known as XSS) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to compromise the interactions that users have 
with a vulnerable application. It allows an attacker to circumvent the same origin policy, which is designed to segregate different 
websites from each other.Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities normally allow an attacker to masquerade as a victim user, to carry out any 
actions that the user is able to perform, and to access any of the user's data. If the victim user has privileged access within the application, 
then the attacker might be able to gain full control over all of the application's functionality and data.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker can inject malicious code into a web page 
viewed by other users. This malicious code can be used to steal sensitive information, such as login credentials or sensitive data, or to perform 
actions on behalf of the user, such as posting a malicious message or making unauthorized purchases.

XSS is a way for attackers to inject malicious scripts into websites that other users view, which can lead to the compromise of sensitive 
information or the unauthorized manipulation of data.

EX :-
An attacker finds a vulnerable web page that allows user-supplied data to be displayed on the page without proper sanitization.
The attacker crafts a malicious script and injects it into the vulnerable page by entering it as a comment or through a form field.
When other users visit the page, the malicious script is executed in their browser, allowing the attacker to steal sensitive information 
such as user credentials or to perform actions on behalf of the affected user.
For example, a website has a search feature that displays search results based on user-supplied keywords. An attacker could craft a malicious 
script that steals the user's cookies and sends them to a server controlled by the attacker. When other users search for something on the site, 
the attacker's script is executed in their browser, and their cookies are sent to the attacker's server.

TYPES OF XSS :-

REFLECTED XSS :- Reflected xss vulnerability arises when application recieves input as a http req and includes that data within the 
immediate response in unsafe way.

ex:- let vulnerable web page has search function that recieves user supplied search term in a url parameter as following:-
https://target.com/search?term=phone
this return a res :- <p> you searched for : phone </phone>
let the web app does not sanitises data then attacker can attack like :-
https://target.com/search?term=<script>alert(document.cookie) </script> </p>
At such a point, if another application user requests the attacker’s URL, then the script supplied by the attacker will execute in the 
victim user’s browser, in the context of their session with the application.

=> reflected xss is also called 1-order xss because its req goes to the server once, and as response to that req attacker 
  can include malicious payload in response, which after execution in victims browser can lead to xss attack.

impact :- 
1) Perform any kind of action that user can perform, if user is admin it can lead to compromise of whole website.
2) view,update,delete any kind of data that user is able to do.
3) Stealing of sensative information of user .
4) session hijacking etc.

                                                                    <==== Reflected XSS Prevention ===>>

Here are a few steps you can take to prevent reflected XSS in your web applications.
a) Sanitizing Inputs
You can sanitize reflected and stored cross-site scripting via the server-side, and there are several ways of carrying this out. 
Denylisting characters that you decide are unsafe won’t work in the long term because malicious users could bypass it.  
Here is how you can use allow-listing to determine what is permitted: 
Utilize a security encoding library for encoding user input and all parameters. If you want to insert user/parameters 
input data into the HTML body, use an HTML escape before the user-supplied string.
Encode all characters that may influence the execution context, whether it shows the start of an event, CSS style, 
script, using a function such as htmlentities().
Escape attributes if you want to insert user/parameter input details into the HTML common attributes. 
Do not employ event handles or attributes such as style, href, or src.
Add quotes to your attributes, and in general, escape every non-alphanumeric character.
Use JavaScript escaping for dynamically created JS code, where you need to insert user/parameters data input into script tags or event handlers. 
The safest place to put data is within any quoted value. Anywhere else, it will be difficult to sanitize since switching context is simple. 

b) Use HTTPOnly Cookie Flag
It is hard to secure against all XSS flaws in your application. To minimize the impact of XSS vulnerabilities, utilize the HTTPOnly 
flag-providing the browser supports it. This flag guarantees that cookies cannot be attained via client side scripts, stopping XSS attacks.  
Use the HTTPOnly flag on session cookies, and all custom cookies are not being accessed by your JavaScript code. 
You enable the flag in .NET applications default. However, it must be activated manually in different languages.   

c) Implement Content Security Policy
Content Security Policy (CSP) is a strategy that helps mitigate the effect of XSS vulnerabilities. 
This browser-side approach allows you to create lists outlining access permissions to client-side resources, 
including CSS and JavaScript. CSP uses an HTTP header to tell the browser to execute resources from the stated sources. 
For example, the following command instructs the site browser to load all resources from an identified source:
Content-Security-Policy: default-src: 'self'; script-src: 'self' static.domain.tld

d) X-XSS-Protection Header
The HTTP X-XSS-Protection header is available in common browsers such as Internet Explorer and Google Chrome, 
filtering suspicious information to stop reflected XSS attacks. When the header identifies XSS, it prevents the page from 
loading without sanitizing inputs within the page.  
Reliance on the X-XSS-Protection header may give rise to more client-side security risks. You should use it with discretion. 
You should set the header to X-XSS-Protection: 0, disabling the XSS Auditor and preventing it from adopting the default response activity of the browser. 

                                                            REFELECTED XSS SCENARIOS :-

a)   XSS BETWEEN HTML TAGS :- 
    Here one needs to introduce some new HTML tags designed to trigger execution of JavaScript when XSS 
    context is text between HTML tags as shown below:
    ex:- 1) <script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
         2) <img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>

     IF nothing is encoded in the response to a req made by victim we can insert scripts into that and in that case 
     the script will execute an we can manage to steal cookie or sensative information.

b)   HTML TAG ATTRIBUTES :- 
       case i) when can occur :- in fields such as input let if angle brackets are not encoded or blocked in such case we
                       can close the brackets of attributes and embeed our script into that as the response.
                      ex :- <input type="text" value="name" />
                            let angle brackets are not encoded
                            so we can test by injecting the payload
                           "><script>alert(document.domain)</script>
                           so this " close the value field and script is executed in the victims browser leading to attack.
       case ii) what if angle brackets are encoded/blocked..
                in this case our script will not execute so in this case we can use event handler to plan our attack..
                 ex :- “autofocus onfocus=alert(document.domain) x=”
                        this will execute and attack is executed..
                  NOTE :- The above payload creates an onfocus event that will execute JavaScript when the element receives the focus, 
                          and also adds the autofocus attribute to try to trigger the onfocus event automatically without any user interaction. 
                          Finally, it adds x=" to gracefully repair the following markup.
                          
     case iii) If xss context is into the href attribute 
               sometime we have link so we can check for javascript pseudo protocol to execute our script.
                The JavaScript pseudo-protocol, often seen as javascript: followed by some JavaScript code, is a feature that allows 
                you to execute JavaScript code directly in the context of a URL.
                For example: <a href=”javascript:alert(document.domain)”>

 c)    XSS INTO JAVASCRIPT :- 
                When xss context is js within the response many attack scenarios can occur...

                                                            << ATTACK SCENARIOS >>
        i) Terminating the existing script :- 
            In the simplest case, it is possible to simply close the script tag that is enclosing the existing JavaScript, 
            and introduce some new HTML tags that will trigger execution of JavaScript. For example, if the XSS context is as follows:

            ex :- let the server is returning a script in respone like
                  <script> 
                        // code ....
                        var input="contollable data"
                  </script>
            solution :- in this case we can exploit it but closing the script and using our own payload.
                        like :- </script><img src=1 onerror alert(document.domain) >

            How this gets executed ...
            we closed the script tag which was being sent as response and inserted our own payload img which 
            on execution can lead to redirecting the victim to our server..
            
         ii) Breaking out of javascript string :- 
             In cases where xss content is inside a quoted string literal it is often possible to break out of string 
             and execute js directly.
             ex :- some ways to break out of string are..
                   '-alert(document.domain)-'
                   ‘;alert(document.domain)//

              Some web applications attempt to prevent input from breaking out of the JavaScript string by escaping any 
              single quote characters with a backslash. A backslash before a character tells the JavaScript parser that 
              the character should be interpreted literally, and not as a special character such as a string terminator. 
              In this situation, applications often make the mistake of failing to escape the backslash character itself. 
              This means that an attacker can use their own backslash character to neutralize the backslash that is added 
              by the application.
              For example, suppose that the input:
              ‘;alert(document.domain)//
              gets converted to:
              \’;alert(document.domain)//
              
              You can now use the alternative payload:
              \’;alert(document.domain)//
              which gets converted to:
              \\’;alert(document.domain)//
              Here, the first backslash means that the second backslash is interpreted literally, and not as a special character. 
              This means that the quote is now interpreted as a string terminator, and so the attack succeeds.
              Some websites make XSS more difficult by restricting which characters you are allowed to use. 
              This can be on the website level or by deploying a WAF that prevents your requests from ever reaching the website. 
              In these situations, you need to experiment with other ways of calling functions which bypass these security measures. 
              One way of doing this is to use the throw statement with an exception handler. This enables you to pass arguments to a 
              function without using parentheses. The following code assigns the alert() function to the global exception handler and 
              the throw statement passes the 1 to the exception handler (in this case alert). The end result is that the alert() function 
              is called with 1 as an argument.

              onerror=alert;throw 1
           
        iii)  Making use of HTML encoding..
              when xss context is existing js within a quoted tag attribute such as an event handler, it is possible to make use of 
              HTML-encoding to work around some input filters.

              When the browser has parsed out the HTML tags and attributes within a response, it will perform HTML-decoding of tag 
              attribute values before they are processed any further. If the server-side application blocks or sanitizes certain characters 
              that are needed for a successful XSS exploit, you can often bypass the input validation by HTML-encoding those characters.
              For example, if the XSS context is as follows:
              <a href=”#” onclick=”… var input=’controllable data here’; …”>
              and the application blocks or escapes single quote characters, you can use the following payload to break out of the 
              JavaScript string and execute your own script:
            
              &apos;-alert(document.domain)-&apos;

              The &apos; sequence is an HTML entity representing an apostrophe or single quote. Because the browser HTML-decodes the value 
              of the onclick attribute before the JavaScript is interpreted, the entities are decoded as quotes, which become string delimiters, 
              and so the attack succeeds.
