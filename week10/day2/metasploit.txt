The Metasploit framework is a set of open-source tools used for network enumeration, identifying vulnerabilities, developing payloads and executing 
exploit code against remote target machines.

Metasploit is the most widely used exploitation framework. Metasploit is a powerful tool that can support all phases of a penetration testing 
engagement, from information gathering to post-exploitation.

The Metasploit Framework is a set of tools that allow information gathering, scanning, exploitation, exploit development, post-exploitation, 
and more. While the primary usage of the Metasploit Framework focuses on the penetration testing domain, it is also useful for vulnerability 
research and exploit development.

The main components of the Metasploit Framework can be summarized as follows;
a) msfconsole: The main command-line interface.
b) Modules: supporting modules such as exploits, scanners, payloads, etc.
c) Tools: Stand-alone tools that will help vulnerability research, vulnerability assessment, or penetration testing. Some of these tools are msfvenom,
   pattern_create and pattern_offset. We will cover msfvenom within this module, but pattern_create and pattern_offset are tools useful in exploit 
   development which is beyond the scope of this module.

Exploit: A piece of code that uses a vulnerability present on the target system.
Vulnerability: A design, coding, or logic flaw affecting the target system. The exploitation of a vulnerability can result in disclosing 
confidential information or allowing the attacker to execute code on the target system.
Payload: An exploit will take advantage of a vulnerability. However, if we want the exploit to have the result we want (gaining access to
the target system, read confidential information, etc.), we need to use a payload. Payloads are the code that will run on the target system.
