What is Mass Assignment?
OWASP attributes the API mass assignment vulnerability as an input validation flaw that allows hackers to 
perform advanced attacks by manipulating payload data.
The threat arises when the API endpoints save a request body as it is instead of extracting request parameters one by one.

Impact:

The main impact of a Mass Assignment vulnerability is linked to modifying or creating variables. Depending on the variables or objects affected, 
the impact can be more or less significant, ranging from the simple modification of a value with no impact to a privilege escalation

How To Prevent
a) If possible, avoid using functions that automatically bind a clientâ€™s input into code variables or internal objects.
b) Whitelist only the properties that should be updated by the client.
c) Use built-in features to blacklist properties that should not be accessed by clients.
d) If applicable, explicitly define and enforce schemas for the input data payloads.
