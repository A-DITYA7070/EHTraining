                STEPS TO REPRODUCE
                1. Configure your browser with a proxy tool like Burp Suite.
                2. Login to the application using  your credentials.
                3. Turn on the intercept of the Burp suite.
                4. Upload a malicious file through upload functionality in the browser.
                5. Send the intercepted request to the Burp Repeater.
                6. In the Burp Repeater response observe that the file has successfully being uploaded.
                7. Make a GET request using Burp Repeater to files/avatars/index.php
                8. Observe that the instead of executing the script server responded with the script 
                9. In the Burp Repeater go to the tab POST /my-account/avatar request and change the 
                   Content-Disposition: form-data; name="avatar"; filename="../exploit.php"
                10. Observe the response that the file have been successfully uploaded This suggests 
                    that the server is stripping the directory traversal sequence from the file name. 
                11. Obfuscate the directory traversal sequence by URL encoding the forward slash (/) character
                    resulting in filename="..%2findex.php"
                12. Send the request and Observe that the message now says the files/avatars/../index.php has been uploaded
                13. From Burp Proxy history find the GET files/avatars/index.php request and send it to Burp Repeater
                    change the request to files/avatars/../index.php and send the request.
                14. In the response Observe that server responded with carlos Secret submit it to solve the lab.
