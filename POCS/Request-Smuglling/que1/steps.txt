                                STEPS TO REPRODUCE :-

                        1. Configure your browser with a proxy tool such as Burp Suite.
                        2. Turn on the intercept of the Burp and in the application refresh the page
                        3. Turn the intercept off and go to HTTP History page and observe the / request 
                        4. Send this request to Burp Repeater.
                        5. In the Request attribute change the protocol from HTTP/2.0 to HTTP/1.1.
                        6. Right click on the request in Burp Repeater and change the request method from GET to POST.
                        7. Click on send and Observe the response it says 200 Ok
                        8. Again click on send and issue the same request 
                        9. Observe the response it says unrecognised method GPOST and the lab is solved.
