                STEPS TO REPRODUCE :-
                1. Cofigure your browser with a proxy tool such as Burp Suite.
                2. Turn on the intercept of the Burp Suite.
                3. Login to the application using your credentials.
                4. In the Burp intercept History tab Observe the /my-account request.
                5. Select this request and send to Burp Repeater.
                6. In the request header select JWT payload part and in the Burp Inspector change sub to administrator.
                7. In the request header select JWT Header part and change alg parameter to "none".
                8. In the request header select signature of jwt and remove it remember to add "." after payload
                9. Click on send and Observe the response.
                10. Server responded with admin-panel
                11. Delete the user carlos.

            Remediation :-
            1. Implement secure signature verification.
            2. validate jwt claims.
            3. Use strong cryptographic Algorithm.
