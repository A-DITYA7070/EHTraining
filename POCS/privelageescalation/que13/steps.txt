step 1) login using administrator account
step 2) change the carlos user to admin and intercept the req
step 3) login through normal user wiener
step 4) in the burp we can see that the req is depending upon the Referer header it's not validating the session
step 5) hence we can use normal users session and change to admin
step 6) copy the session cookie from normal user and paste it in the repeater and make the req
step 7) change the id=wiener we can see that lab is solved
