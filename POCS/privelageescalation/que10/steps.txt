step 1) Try to load /admin and observe that you get blocked. Notice that the response is very plain, 
        suggesting it may originate from a front-end system.
step 2) Send the request to Burp Repeater. Change the URL in the request line to / and add the HTTP header 
        X-Original-URL: /invalid. Observe that the application returns a "not found" response. This indicates 
        that the back-end system is processing the URL from the X-Original-URL header.
step 3) Change the value of the X-Original-URL header to /admin. Observe that you can now access the admin page.
step 4) To delete carlos, add ?username=carlos to the real query string, and change the X-Original-URL path to /admin/delete
step 5) after processing this req we can see that lab is solved..
