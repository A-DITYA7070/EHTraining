1) In this lab we want 

=> in backend the query running is ::-

select login_name,login_password from table where id=1;
select login_name,login_password from table where id=2;

so in the url we only need to pass the ?id=1 field..



We can break the query by using single quote (fuzzing) and then we can use comments and inject our query to retrive data..
