                          LAB # 1 Manipulating WebSocket messages to exploit vulnerabilities

            1. Configure your browser with proxy tool such as Burp Suite.
            2. Turn on the intercept and send <script>alert(1)</script> in the chat 
            3. In the intercepted request observe that the special characters are encoded.
            4. Change it to <img src=1 onerror='alert(1)'> 
            5. Forward the request and observe the response.
            6. The Lab is solved.
