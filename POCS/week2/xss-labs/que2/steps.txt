steps :- 
       1) its a stored xss hence we will look for any area to store our malicious scripts after scrolling we can see that 
          comments is the area which we can target and store our scripts.
       2) After that i tried to comment and sent the req using burp in which there are 4 input areas 
          i) name
          ii)comments
          iii)email
          iv)website
        3) we can see that after comment its getting posted at the comment section and after clicking it we are being redirected to
        the website we are entering in the burp response we can se 302 redirect response as well
        4) so this is the area we can target
        5) hence after entering payload http://adi.com<script>alert(document.domain)</script> and url encoding (:,//,<,>)
          and sending req 
        6) we can see that the lab is solved..

reason :- 
      It worked because input is not sanatised and we can store the payload in the database and when any user clicks the link 
      the script is returned back to the users browser and browser js engine runs the script.

Remediation :- 
         i) sanatise the angle brackets before taking input from the user 
         ii) never trust user input and be very carefull when you are storing data in db after takin i/p 
         iii) always have validation at server side and sanatise data before storing into db..
