                      DOM XSS in innerHTML sink using source location.search


steps :- 

       1) after searching for "aditya" we can see that the function doSearchQuery changes the HTML contents of a div element, 
          using data from location.search. using innerHTML
       2) hence we need to craft our payload so that when our script will get inerserted in the html in place of div element
          it should execute our script
       3) hence we can use the payload <img src=1 onerror=alert(1) > which will get inserted at the place of div and since its an
          error the onerror event will get triggered and our work will be done 

how it worked :- 
       we can see that whatever we are entering there is a variable named query which is storing our input 
       and it is checking that 
       like we searched for "aditya"
       then query is storing aditya 
       i.e var query = "aditya"
       and it is checking that if there is query a func named doSearchQuery() is getting called
       i.e if(query){
         doSearchQuery();
       }
       now lets understand the func 
       function doSearchQuery(query){
           document.getElementById('search').innerHTML=query;
       }
       it is taking query i.e (aditya in this case) as parameter and inserting it as html in search field 
       now we can understand that when our payload <img src=1 onerror=alert(1)> is sent as parameter it is 
       stored in query and is inserted as html in search field and its got executed..
