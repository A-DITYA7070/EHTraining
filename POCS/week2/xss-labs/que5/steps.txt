steps :- 
    i) after sending feeback submit req from burpsuite we can see that it returned with 200 statuscode
    ii) after inspecting the ele we can see that the backlink returnPath is getting embedded into <a href="/feedback/backlink />
    iii) and after clicking the back link its getting inserted as parameter in a self invoked func which getting executed 
            after clicking the back button.
            It uses the jQuery library's $ selector function to find an anchor element, and changes 
            its href attribute using data from location.search. 
    iv) hence we need to insert a js code that will get executed
    v) hence payload javascript:alert(1) works here in the return path and as a result i solved the lab..
