STEPS :-

1. HERE we can see there is one input field hence we can first search and see where the result is Reflected back..
2. We can see that after searching for 'aditya' in the input field it is Reflected back in <h1> </h1> 
3. Now we move further to test whether we can bypass </h1> or not so let's try this.
4. after executing the payload :- </h1><script>alert(document.domain)</script>
5. we can see that we are able to alert the cookie 


why it worked....

reason :- since after first search we can see that the search text is directly getting embedded into <h1> </h1> (h1 tag)
          and reflecting back to the user so in the response we just need to insert a script and browser compiler will execute it.

Remediation :- 
            1) we can use html encoding.
            2) sanatise input  (angle brackets)
