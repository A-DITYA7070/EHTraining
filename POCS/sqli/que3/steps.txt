                    STEPS TO REPRODUCE :-
                    1. Configure your browser with a proxy tool such as Burp Repeater.
                    2. Trun on the intercept in the Burp Repeater 
                    3. Make a request in the browser to filter products 
                    4. Send the intercepted request to the Burp Repeater
                    5. In the Repeater Request change the category=' 
                       and observe the response which is internal server error this suggest 
                       that there can be sql injection possible
                    6. In the category=' change the payload to '+UNION+SELECT+NULL -- 
                       observe the response it still says internal server error.
                    7. Change the payload to category='+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL,NULL-- and observe the 
                       response which is 200 OK which suggest that there is 3 columns in the db.
                    












NOTES :-
 This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are 
 returned in the application's response, so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables. The 
 first step of such an attack is to determine the number of columns that are being returned by the query. You will
 then use this technique in subsequent labs to construct the full attack.
 To solve the lab, determine the number of columns returned by the query by performing a SQL injection UNION attack
 that returns an additional row containing null values.
