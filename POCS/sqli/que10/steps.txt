                            STEPS TO REPRODUCE
                            1. Configure your browser with a proxy tool such as Burp Suite
                            2. In the Burp turn the intercept on and in the application click on categories
                            3. Send the intercepted request to Burp Repeater
                            4. In the request change the category=' and observe the response it's internal server error
                               with 500 status code suggesting that there is sql injection vulnerability
                            5. Replace the payload category=' to category='+UNION+SELECT+NULL,+NULL-- send the request and 
                               observe the response it's 200 OK
                            6. Replace the payload to category='+UNION+SELECT+NULL,'abc'-- click on send and observe the response
                               it's 200 OK suggesting that there are two columns and 2nd column accept string 
                            7. Replace the payload category='+UNION+SELECT+NULL,username||'~'||password+FROM+users-- and Observe   
                               the respose, application responded with administrator username and password
                            8. In the application navigate to /login and login with the recieved username and password.

Retrieving multiple values within a single column

In some cases the query in the previous example may only return a single column.

You can retrieve multiple values together within this single column by concatenating the values together. 
You can include a separator to let you distinguish the combined values. For example, on Oracle you could submit the input:
' UNION SELECT username || '~' || password FROM users--

This uses the double-pipe sequence || which is a string concatenation operator on Oracle. The injected query concatenates
 together the values of the username and password fields, separated by the ~ character.

The results from the query contain all the usernames and passwords, for example:
...
administrator~s3cure
wiener~peter
carlos~montoya
...
