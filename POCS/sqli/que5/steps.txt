                     LAB #5 SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on MySQL and Microsoft


                STEPS TO REPRODUCE :-
                1. Configure browser with a proxy tool such as Burp Suite
                2. Turn on the intercept and refine your search.
                3. Send the Intercepted request to Burp Repeater.
                4. Change the category=' and Observe the response it's Internal server error 
                   which suggest that the database is vulnerable to sql injection
                5. Url encode this payload  '+UNION+SELECT+'abc','def' # and use it instead of '
                   Observe the response its responded with abc and def string which suggest that 
                   it has two column.
                6. Url encode this payload '+UNION+SELECT+@@version,+NULL# and replace it with the previous payload
                7. Observe the response the database responded with the version number of sql.

NOTES :-

Using a SQL injection UNION attack to retrieve interesting data

When you have determined the number of columns returned by the original query and found which columns can hold string data, 
you are in a position to retrieve interesting data.

Suppose that:

    The original query returns two columns, both of which can hold string data.
    The injection point is a quoted string within the WHERE clause.
    The database contains a table called users with the columns username and password.

In this example, you can retrieve the contents of the users table by submitting the input:
' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--

In order to perform this attack, you need to know that there is a table called users with two columns called
 username and password. Without this information, you would have to guess the names of the tables and columns.
  All modern databases provide ways to examine the database structure, and determine what tables and columns they
   contain.
