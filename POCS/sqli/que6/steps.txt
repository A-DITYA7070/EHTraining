                        1. Configure your browser with proxy tool such as Burp Suite
                        2. Turn on the intercept in Burp Suite
                        3. In the Browser click on corporate gifts 
                        4. Send the intercepted request to Repeater
                        5. In the request change the category=' and observe the response 
                           it's 500 Internal server error, it suggest that there is sql injection vulnerability.
                        6. Now check for how many columns the table has for this 
                           change the category=' to category='+UNION+SELECT+NULL+FROM+dual--
                           it's still giving 500 internal server error in the response.
                        7. Now again change the payload category='+UNION+SELECT+NULL,+NULL+FROM+dual--
                           it's giving 200 OK which suggest that table has two columns.
                        8. Now replace the query and add category='+UNION+SELECT+BANNER,+NULL+FROM+v@version--
                        9. Observe the response the table responded with it's version.
