                STEPS TO REPRODUCE :-
                1. Configure your browser with a proxy tool such as Burp Suite.
                2. Turn on the intercept of the Burp Suite.
                3. In the application click on check stocks.
                4. Send the intercepted request to Burp Repeater.
                5. In the Repeater observe that the productId and storeId is sent to the server in xml format.
                6. In the storeId enter "'" instead of 1 and click on send.
                7. Observe the response which says "attack detected", this suggest that the web application firewall 
                   is checking syntax which can be used to exploit sql injection vulnerabalities.
                8. Hence we will use an extension called Hackvertor to bypass this waf.
                9. Go to BAAP store in Burp suite and search extension named "Hackvertor" and install it.
               10. Click on Hackvertor and use the payload 1 Union select username || '~' || password from users
                   and click on hex_entities.
               11. copy the payload and paste it in storeId field in the Burp Repeater request.
               12. click on send.
               13. Observe the response administrator username and password can be seen use it and login to the application and 
                   lab is solved.
