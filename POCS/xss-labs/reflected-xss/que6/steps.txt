                     STEPS TO REPRODUCE :-

                    1. Configure your browser with proxy tool such as Burp Suite.
                    2. Turn on the intercept and in the application refresh the page.
                    3. Send the intercept request to Burp Repeater.
                    4. There is no input field except url hence we will use url to exploit.
                    5. Use this payload /?accesskey='x'onclick='alert(1) and click on send 
                    6. When the user will click on ctrl+shift+x the alert function will be triggered.
                    
            REMEDIATION :-
            1. Url sanitisation.
