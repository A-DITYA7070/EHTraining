                            STEPS TO REPRODUCE :-
                            1. Configure your browser with a proxy tool such as Burp Suite.
                            2. Turn on the intercept of the Burp Suite and in the application search for some random text in search field
                            3. In the Burp send this intercepted request to Burp Repeater and turn the intercept off.
                            4. In the Burp Repeater click on send and Observe the response, the output is returned in <h1> tag.
                            5. Try to break the tag by entering this payload </h1><script>alert(1)</script> 
                            6. Observe the response it says tag is not allowed.
                            7. Send this request to Burp Intruder and in the payload tab copy all the payloads (tags) from Portswigger.
                            8. Add scope in place of tag and click on start attack.
                            9. Wait for the attack to complete and Observe the status code having 200 ok.
                           10. Note down the tag in which response is 200 ok.
                           11. Observe that <body> tag has 200 ok response.
                           12. Finally use this payload 
                            <iframe src="https://APP-ID.web-security-academy.net/?search=%22%3E%3Cbody%20onresize=print()%3E" onload=this.style.width='100px'>
                               and deliver this to victim.
