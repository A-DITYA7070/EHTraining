                    STEPS TO REPRODUCE :-
                    1. Configure your browser with proxy tool such as Burp Suite.
                    2. Turn on the intercept of the Burp suite and search for some random value in the input field.
                    3. Send the intercepted request to Burp Repeater.
                    4. In the Repeater click on send and Observe the response.
                    5. The text we searched is reflected back in <h1> tag.
                    6. Try to break the tag with </h1><script>alert(1)</scritp> but we can see that the tag is not allowed.
                    7. send this request to intruder and add tag in scope and copy the tags from Portswigger and start the attack.
                    8. Observe the statuscode and see if there is 200 ok reposne Observetgat there is 200 ok for svg tag.
                    9. Also most of the event handlers are blocked but we can confirm that animate is not blocked.
                   10. Hence we can craft out payload using there tags and eventhandlers.
                   11. Finally use this payload := "%3Csvg%3E%3Ca%3E%3Canimate+attributeName%3Dhref+values%3Djavascript%3Aalert(1)
                                                   +%2F%3E%3Ctext+x%3D20+y%3D20%3EClick%20me%3C%2Ftext%3E%3C%2Fa%3E"
                       and click on send.
                   12. Observe the response it's 200 ok 
                   13. Deliver this payload to victim and the lab is solved.
                
                Remediation :-
                1. Input sanitisation.
                2. Output encoding.
                3. Csp headers.
