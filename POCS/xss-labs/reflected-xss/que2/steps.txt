            STEPS TO REPRODUCE :-
            1. Configure your browser with a proxy tool such as Burp Suite.
            2. Turn on the intercept of Burp suite and from the application input search for random text.
            3. Observe that the output is reflected back in <h1> tag.
            4. Use this payload </h1><scrit>alert(1)</script> and try to break the tag.
            5. Observe that the tag is not allowed response is recieved from the server.
            6. Send this request to Burp Intruder.
            7. Add the tag part in scope and copy all tags from the Portswigger website and paste it to the payload section.
            8. Click on start attack.
            9. Observe the response having 200 ok note the tag which are allowed.
           10. Notice that the all tags are blocked hence we will have to use event-handlers to perform the attack.
           11. Use this payload %3Cxss+id%3Dx+onfocus%3Dalert%28document.cookie%29%20tabindex=1%3E in the search part 
               and click on send.
           12. Observe the response its 200 ok hence our payload has been accepted by the server.
           13. Finally deliver this exploit to victim to solve the lab.
        
        Remediation

        2. Input sanitisation.
        3. Output encoding.
