                        STEPS TO REPRODUCE :-
                    
                    1. Configure your browser with proxy tool such as Burp Suite.
                    2. Turn on the intercept of the Burp Suite and search for random text in application search bar.
                    3. Send the intercepted request to Burp Repeater.
                    4. Click on send and Observe the response angle brackets are encoded, hence we can not use any payload 
                       that has angle brackets.
                    5. Hence we will have to use event handlers for this so use this payload 
                       "autofocus onfocus='alert(1)' x=" and click on search.
                    
            
            REMEDIATION :-
            1. Output encoding whole output not just angle brackets.
            2. Input sanitisation.
