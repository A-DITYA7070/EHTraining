Bypassing SameSite restrictions using on-site gadgets
If a cookie is set with the SameSite=Strict attribute, browsers won't include it in any cross-site requests. 
You may be able to get around this limitation if you can find a gadget that results in a secondary request within the same site.

One possible gadget is a client-side redirect that dynamically constructs the redirection target using attacker-controllable
 input like URL parameters. For some examples, see our materials on DOM-based open redirection.

As far as browsers are concerned, these client-side redirects aren't really redirects at all; the resulting request is just 
treated as an ordinary, standalone request. Most importantly, this is a same-site request and, as such, will include all cookies
 related to the site, regardless of any restrictions that are in place.

If you can manipulate this gadget to elicit a malicious secondary request, this can enable you to bypass any SameSite cookie 
restrictions completely. 


Note that the equivalent attack is not possible with server-side redirects. In this case, browsers recognize that the request to
 follow the redirect resulted from a cross-site request initially, so they still apply the appropriate cookie restrictions.
