In order to perform csrf there must be :-
i) A relevant action
ii) Cookie-based session handling
iii) No unpredictable req params.. (csrf token is not mandatory) 

Testing csrf token :- 
1) Remove the csrf token and see if the app accepts it.. (yes hence its vulnerable )
2) test req method from post  to get
3) see if csrf token is tied to users session or not :- in this case csrf token is not tied to user's session 

what does it mean 
Some applications do not validate that the token belongs to the same session as the user who is making the request. 
Instead, the application maintains a global pool of tokens that it has issued and accepts any token that 
appears in this pool.
