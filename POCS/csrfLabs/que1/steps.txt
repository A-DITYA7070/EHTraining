vulnerable parameter :- email change functionality :--
Goal := exploit the csrf vulnerability and change the email address 

creds :- wiener:peter

Inorder to satisfy CSRF attacks to possible:-
- A relevant action   - yes
- Cookie based session handling  - yes 
- No unpredictable req parameters - yes 


1) It's vulnerable to csrf because all the condition for csrf is valid hence we can exploit it
2) a req to change email is sent to burp 
3) from there i took the lab-id and endpoint and since the user is logged in to burp its cookie is stored in the browser
4) in /csrf-lab1.html i crafted the payload making a req to change the email which has an iframe ele and a hidden i/p ele
which sets the value of email to our desired email 
5) after hosting it to my local server when this link http://localhost:4500/hack is opened in the browser the email is updated
   and after delivering the payload to server we can see the lab is solved..
