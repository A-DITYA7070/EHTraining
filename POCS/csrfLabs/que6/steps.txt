In order to perform csrf there must be :-
i) A relevant action
ii) Cookie-based session handling
iii) No unpredictable req params.. 


Testing csrf token :- 
1) Remove the csrf token and see if the app accepts it.. (yes hence its vulnerable )
2) test req method from post  to get
3) see if csrf token is tied to users session or not
4) 
    Testing CSRF tokens and CSRF COOKIES :- 
      1) check if csrf token is tied to csrf cookie
        -submit an invalid csrf token
        -submit a valid csrf token from another user 
      2) Submit a valid csrf token and cookie from another user 

      csrf token :-
      csrf cookie :- 

In order to exploit this vulnerability we need to perform 2 things 
1) inject a csrf cookie in the user's session (HTTP header injection)
2) send a csrf attack to the victim with a known csrf token

IF THE token is duplicated in cookie
