How to turn off form autocompletion

By default, browsers remember information that the user submits through <input> fields on websites. This enables the browser to offer 
autocompletion (that is, suggest possible completions for fields that the user has started typing in) or autofill (that is, pre-populate 
certain fields upon load).

These features are usually enabled by default, but they can be a privacy concern for users, so browsers can let users disable them. However,
some data submitted in forms either are not useful in the future (for example, a one-time pin) or contain sensitive information (for example,
a unique government identifier or credit card security code). As website author, you might prefer that the browser not remember the values for
such fields, even if the browser's autocomplete feature is enabled.

Note that the WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.3.5: Identify Input Purpose does not require that autocomplete/autofill actually work - merely that
form fields that relate to specific personal user information are programmatically identified. This means that the criterion can be passed (by
adding the relevant autocomplete attributes to individual form fields) even when autocompletion for the form itself has been turned off.

Disabling autocompletion
To disable autocompletion in forms, you can set the autocomplete attribute to "off":

autocomplete="off"
You can do this either for an entire form, or for specific input elements in a form:

HTML
Copy to Clipboard
<form method="post" action="/form" autocomplete="off">
  …
</form>
HTML
Copy to Clipboard
<form method="post" action="/form">
  …
  <div>
    <label for="cc">Credit card:</label>
    <input type="text" id="cc" name="cc" autocomplete="off" />
  </div>
</form>
Setting autocomplete="off" on fields has two effects:

It tells the browser not to save data inputted by the user for later autocompletion on similar forms, though heuristics for complying vary
by browser.It stops the browser from caching form data in the session history. When form data is cached in session history, the information
filled in by the user is shown in the case where the user has submitted the form and clicked the Back button to go back to the original form page.
If a browser keeps on making suggestions even after setting autocomplete to off, then you have to change the name attribute of the input element.

The autocomplete attribute and login fields
Modern browsers implement integrated password management: when the user enters a username and password for a site, the browser offers to remember 
it for the user. When the user visits the site again, the browser autofills the login fields with the stored values.

Additionally, the browser enables the user to choose a master password that the browser will use to encrypt stored login details.

Even without a master password, in-browser password management is generally seen as a net gain for security. Since users do not have to remember
passwords that the browser stores for them, they are able to choose stronger passwords than they would otherwise.

For this reason, many modern browsers do not support autocomplete="off" for login fields:

If a site sets autocomplete="off" for a <form>, and the form includes username and password input fields, then the browser still offers to remember
this login, and if the user agrees, the browser will autofill those fields the next time the user visits the page.
If a site sets autocomplete="off" for username and password <input> fields, then the browser still offers to remember this login, and if the user 
agrees, the browser will autofill those fields the next time the user visits the page.
Preventing autofilling with autocomplete="new-password"
If you are defining a user management page where a user can specify a new password for another person, and therefore you want to prevent autofilling 
of password fields, you can use autocomplete="new-password".

This is a hint, which browsers are not required to comply with. However modern browsers have stopped autofilling <input> elements with
autocomplete="new-password" for this very reason. For example, Firefox version 67 (see Firefox bug 1119063) stopped autofilling in this
case; however, Firefox 70 (see Firefox bug 1565407) can suggest securely-generated passwords, but does not autofill a saved password.
See the autocomplete compat table for more details.


==>> Autocomplete attribute on login fields
    Many modern browsers include an integrated password management feature and do not support autocomplete="off" for login fields. 
    Even if set on the form or password field, the browser will still allow the user to save the credentials for autofill on future visits. 
    Reporting autocomplete not disabled is therefore not meaningful for such login fields as it will not make any difference. 

     All instances listed under the Password Field with autocomplete enabled finding in Burp Suite's Target Tab can therefore be seen as 
     false positives and do not need to be included in the report.


TESTING GUIDANCE ::-
1. Review all non-password form fields that may contain sensitive data, such as credit card data, PII, bank account details, etc. 
   See Sensitive Data Definitions for additional info.
2. For every input field that allows the user to enter sensitive information, use the browser's Developer Tools to inspect the field. 
   Ensure that the autocomplete attribute is explicitly set to "off" on either the field itself or the form tag.
3. Some new values exist as well, such as "current-password" for password fields. These values should be treated identically to the 
   autocomplete attribute not being present. Thus, for example, on password fields, this value would not be reported.
4. Test the input field of interest in different browsers to confirm the finding. If the input field does not appear to show a dropdown 
   even without autocomplete explicitly set to off, please work with TO on how to go about reporting these types of instances.

EX :-
Autocomplete disabled in an input field
<input type="text" name="SSN" autocomplete="off" class="VwCw" tabindex="-1" aria-hidden="true" spellcheck="false" jsname="RHeR4d">
Autocomplete disabled for all inputs in a form
<form method="post" action="/sampleform" autocomplete="off">
  <input type="text" name="SSN">
  <input type="text" name="Bank Account Number">
</form>


Reporting Guidance:
This finding should be reported if the input field is used for entering sensitive information such as SSN, credit/debit card numbers, etc., 
without having autocomplete disabled for neither the field or form.
