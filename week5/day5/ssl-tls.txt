1. Weak Encryption Algorithm :- Some older encryption algorithms such as SSL 2.0 and 3.0 and TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are no longer considered secure 
                                and can be vulnerable to attacks. Itâ€™s important to use the most up-to-date encryption protocols to ensure 
                                security.

2. Certificate validation issues: Web applications can be vulnerable if the SSL/TLS certificate validation is not performed properly.
                                Attackers can exploit this by using a fake certificate, man-in-the-middle attacks, or other techniques to intercept 
                                and steal data.
