MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions. It's a standard that extends the format of email messages to support different 
types of content beyond simple text. MIME defines a structure for email messages that allows them to include attachments, non-text content like images and videos, 
and to specify character sets other than ASCII.

Here are some key points about MIME:

Content Types: MIME allows email messages to contain different types of content, such as text, images, audio, video, and application data. 
Each type of content is identified by a content type header, which specifies the data format and encoding method.

Multi-part Messages: MIME supports multi-part messages, where different parts of the message can have different content types and encodings. 
This enables email messages to include both text and non-text content, such as attachments or inline images.

Content Transfer Encoding: MIME defines mechanisms for encoding binary data into a format that can be safely transmitted over email systems. 
Common encoding methods include Base64 and quoted-printable, which convert binary data into ASCII characters.

Character Sets: MIME supports different character sets, allowing email messages to be written in languages that use character sets other than ASCII. 
Common character sets include UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, and others.

Overall, MIME plays a crucial role in facilitating the exchange of richly formatted email messages containing various types of content. 
It's widely adopted and supported by email clients, servers, and other email-related software.


MAGIC NUMBER :::---
A magic number, in the context of computer science and file formats, refers to a unique sequence of bytes located at the beginning of a 
file that identifies the file's format or type. It's called a "magic number" because it acts like a unique signature or marker that helps 
software determine the type of file it's dealing with, even if it doesn't rely on the file extension.

Magic numbers are commonly used in various file formats, including executable files, image files, audio files, and archive files, among others. 
They are typically placed at a fixed offset within the file's header.

For example:
A PNG image file begins with the bytes 89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A.
A GIF image file begins with the bytes 47 49 46 38.
A ZIP archive file begins with the bytes 50 4B 03 04.
When software reads a file, it can examine the magic number at the beginning of the file to determine its type 
and how to interpret its contents.This is particularly useful when file extensions are missing or incorrect, or when 
the software needs to verify that a file is in the expected format before processing it.
Using magic numbers helps improve the robustness and reliability of software by reducing reliance on file extensions 
and ensuring correct handling of files even in ambiguous situations.


FILE EXTENSIONS :::---

A file extension is a suffix added to the end of a filename, separated by a period, which indicates the file's format or type. 
File extensions are used by operating systems and applications to associate files with specific programs or to identify the 
type of content contained within the file.

For example:

In the filename "document.txt", the file extension is ".txt", indicating that it is a text file.
In the filename "image.jpg", the file extension is ".jpg", indicating that it is a JPEG image file.
In the filename "presentation.pptx", the file extension is ".pptx", indicating that it is a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation file.
File extensions serve several purposes:

File Type Identification: They help both users and software identify the type of content contained within a file. 
This information is used by operating systems to determine which application should be used to open or process the file.

Association with Applications: Operating systems and applications use file extensions to associate files with specific programs 
or applications capable of opening or processing them. For example, a file with the ".docx" extension is typically associated with Microsoft Word.

Default Programs: Users can set default programs for opening specific file types based on their extensions. For example, 
a user might choose to open all files with the ".pdf" extension with Adobe Acrobat Reader by default.

File Format Standardization: File extensions often correspond to specific file formats or standards, providing a standardized way to identify and categorize files.

While file extensions are commonly used to identify file types, they are not always reliable indicators of file content, 
as they can be changed or manipulated. Therefore, it's important for software to verify the file's format using other means,
such as examining the file's header or magic number, especially when security or reliability is a concern.
