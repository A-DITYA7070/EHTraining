1) PATH Traversal vulnerabality ::---
A Path Traversal Vulnerability occurs when you are able to access or traverse through files outside of the intended directories, 
often allowing an attacker to access content outside the web root (www) directory. Any files residing on the local server like passwd, 
shadow or system configuration files can be accessed (provided the web application is executing with necessarily privileges) which 
leads to critical information leakage.

ex :- https://test.example.com/filename=gift.png 
it can be manipulated by the attacker to https://test.example.com/filename=../../../etc/passwd  :- it will display all the contents of the file /etc/passwd

What to look for ::-
i)   Request parameters with file related operations, interesting variable names, unusual file extensions.
ii)  Cookies used by the web application for dynamic generation of pages or templates.
iii) The path in the URL itself, e.g. misconfigured alias in NGINX can lead to path traversal
EX::-
http://example.com/getUserProfile.jsp?item=ikki.html
http://example.com/index.php?file=content
http://example.com/main.cgi?home=index.htm
Cookie: ID=d9ccd3f4f9f18cc1:TM=2166255468:LM=1162655568:S=3cFpqbJgMSSPKVMV:TEMPLATE=flower
Cookie: USER=1826cc8f:PSTYLE=GreenDotRed


How to test:
    Let's take an example scenario:
    Eg: http://vulnerable_host/vuln_page.php?file=test.php 
    In this example, the file parameter is taking a file called "test.php" , which is located on the same directory as "vuln_page.php", and executing it.
    We are assuming that the test.php file is hosted at /var/www/html/test.php
    Now, we know the directory structure of a regular web server so these files have to be hosted under the www directory.
    We will now try to put the value of file parameter as ../../../etc/passwd
    What this does is, the application treats ../ as traversing back to the parent directory. We have ../ three times(you can add more, depending on
the www directory location) 
    to make sure we are on the root folder. 
    Now /etc/passwd takes you to the passwd file and the file parameter will try to read that file and display it on the browser.
    You are now able to traverse through directories and read internal system files. 
    The final URL would be something like this: http://vulnerable_host/vuln_page.php?file=/../../../etc/passwd


Reporting Guidance:
This finding should be reported whenever you are able to access files outside of the intended directories (e.g., outside the web directory, or any other files 
on the system that are not directly accessible from the web application). 


2) FILE PATH DISCLOSURE

What to look for:
    Triage scan results indicating file path disclosure
    Review application code visible to the client, including html and javascript files.
    Check if directory browsing is enabled.
    Review error messages that could reveal detailed information like full path disclosure. Errors associated with file upload functionality are a good place to look.
    Examples of what file path disclosures might look like:
    /home/omg/htdocs/file/
    C:\Users\test\public_html\includes\functions.php

Reporting Guidance:
The finding should be reported if the application discloses an absolute file path on the server.

Do not report this finding, if:
    The path being referenced is actually a URL, rather than a file path.
    The path is a relative path or URL rewriting is used by the server.
    The path disclosed were from documentation/help pages intended to be used by the user.
    The path disclosed is actually a local path on your machine (during file upload).


File Uploads Testing: Resource Exhaustion
Do not test for resource exhaustion unless agreed with client
Do not carry out these tests unless specifically requested by the client. If you think the client may benefit from these tests, 
propose them and get permission in writing first. You should not attempt any resource exhaustion tests unless explicitly agreed to with the client.
Test cases that may lead to resource exhaustion are not in scope by default. Our current legal datasheets state the following:
Unless previously communicated, denial of service testing, particularly excessive CPU or disk consumption, network flooding, and deliberate attempts 
to exploit known DoS vulnerabilities, is not in scope and will not be tested. 
Resource exhaustion, sometimes manifested as denial of service or severe degradation of quality of service, occurs when we trick the server into throwing 
all of its processing power, memory or disk space at our file.
    Test Cases
        Are there file size restrictions?
            Reporting Policy
        If it is an image, are there restrictions on dimensions?
            Reporting Policy
        If it is possible to upload an archive, will the application try to extract it on the server?
            How to determine impact

Are there file size restrictions?
ASVS Reference: 12.1.1 Verify that the application will not accept large files that could fill up storage or cause a denial of service attack.
Review the use case of the file upload functionality, and where files might be stored, to determine reasonable file sizes that should be accepted.
For example, a profile picture upload should not require files larger than a few megabyte, whereas a video upload service could probably accept much 
larger files (e.g., Youtube allows several gigabytes). If the application looks like it is expecting small files (kilo or megabytes), but accepts arbitrarily
large files (gigabytes), you may be able to use up all disk space or drive the cloud infrastructure bill up by uploading large files.

Upload a large file that is over a reasonable threshold to see if it passes. You can generate files of arbitrary size using a tool or script and telling 
it how many bytes you want. Below are two examples for generating a file of 50Mb:
Python script to generate a test file of 50Mb
python -c "print('A'*52428800)" > testfile.tmp
Using FSUtil to generate test file of 50Mb
fsutil file createnew testfile.tmp 52428800

Reporting Policy
Scenario
The upload of large files succeeds without errors and there is some sort of confirmation the file has been accepted.
	The file upload results in an error indication violation of maximum request length, file size or similar that indicates size of file uploads are restricted. 
Guidance
Report as Resource Exhaustion via File Upload.
Reduce the impact to 'Low' if there is a file size restriction in place but it's deemed to be larger than necessary for the use case of the file upload.
	No issue - do not report

If it is an image, are there restrictions on dimensions?
If the application is doing image processing, image dimensions need to be sanity checked.
This is because width and height properties in image files do not have to match the actual image data contained in the file.

Let's say your width and height properties are set to 1 000 000 and 2 000 000. However, the bitmap pixel data only contains data for an image with the 
size of 1 by 2 pixels (2 pixels). When this image gets converted from one format to another or gets resized by the application, it may:

    try to allocate memory based on the width and height properties (memory exhaustion)
    try to read memory from the bitmap pixel data block based on width and height properties (memory corruption)

How this will manifest itself to you:

    the entire application may become unresponsive (ran out of memory or crashed)
    the request may return an error or time out (thread crashed or timed out)
    application may generate a resized/converted image with data that was read from memory of the server process (like Heartbleed)

If you observe this, proceed to determining impact.

You can generate a test file from any JPEG image using this code: lottapixel.c

The resulting image file is not attached to this page because it tends to cause all sorts of issues with image viewers and image processing software.

If it is possible to upload an archive, will the application try to extract it on the server?

ASVS Reference: 12.1.2 Verify that compressed files are checked for "zip bombs" - small input files that will decompress into huge files thus exhausting file storage limits.

Although many libraries have fixed this, if the application is attempting to manually traverse recursive ZIP files, it may be vulnerable to ZIP bomb attacks.

A ZIP-bomb, or more generally, compression bomb, exploits the properties of compressed file formats to use up all available disk space and/or memory.

For a simple example, consider this: how would you compress a string of 255 repetitions of character "A"? It would be something like: "A" "times" "255". 
This compreses 255 bytes of data into just 3 bytes: "A", operation "times" and agument "255".

Next, imagine you can throw nesting into this. Imagine that this string of 255 repetitions of character "A" can be represented with another character, "B". 
Now, every time we say "B" in the compressed file, it decompresses to 255 "A"s. This, adapted to restrictions of the ZIP format, is how ZIP-bombs came to be.

A popular example, cited on Wikipedia, is a 42-kilobyte ZIP file that decompresses to 4.5 petabytes. In 2019, a recursion-less approach yielded a 46-megabyte 
file that expands to 4.5 petabytes without using nested archives.

To test for recursive ZIP-bombs:

    Do NOT use the 4.5 petabyte file.
    Upload synopsys_zbdeep.zip that extracts 2KB to 1GB. This is 10 layers deep and 2 archives wide. This much depth should be rejected by secure ZIP parsing code.
    If you need to generate test archives with different parameters, get the source code from here: https://github.com/pandasauce/zip-bomb
    The command used to generate the file in #2 is:
    python zip-bomb.py nested-depth -D 10 -C 2 out.zip

To test for non-recursive ZIP-bombs:

    Do NOT use the 4.5 petabyte file.
    Upload synopsys_zbsm.zip that extracts 22KB to 105MB. This file contains overlapping entries and should be rejected by secure ZIP parsing code.
    If you need to generate bigger test archives or archives containing specific payloads, get the source code from here: https://www.bamsoftware.com/git/zipbomb.git
    The command used to generate the file in #2 is:
    python zipbomb --mode=quoted_overlap --num-files=5 --compressed-size=21179 > zbsm.zip
    To include specific files in the bomb, you will need to apply template_fix.patch and use the --template argument to provide a ZIP file with the specific
files you want to include. More detailed explanations of arguments are available in the readme.

If these archives are accepted and files are extracted OR the server becomes unresponsive/returns an error, report the resource exhaustion finding.
How to determine impact
Scenario	Malicious archives upload successfully. The entire application becomes unresponsive or only returns errors.	

Malicious archives upload successfully. There is indication that they are being processed, e.g. you can access the extracted files, there is a log entry that
shows files got extracted or a log entry that shows a hanging/timing out extraction process, however, the application remains functional.
Malicious archives upload successfully. There is no indication that they were getting processed, e.g. files are not extracted, there is no sign of application
slow-down or there is a log message showing that the file got discarded without processing it.

REMOTE CODE EXECUTION ::----
Remote code execution can be achieved when the uploaded files are interpreted as code.
Don't leave any shells behind
If you do succeed with any of the test cases on this page, remember to clean up after yourself! We do not want backdoors from our
testing to remain on client websites. Confirm that the web shell you uploaded is removed once you've completed your testing, and 
make sure to inform the client about any potential files left behind after your testing that they may need to clean up and remove.

Do you know where the files end up after being uploaded?

Common destinations are:
    A folder on the same host
    A different host, for example, an image file server
    Cloud storage, for example, an S3 bucket
If it is in an S3 bucket or a dedicated server configured to serve images, you are unlikely to get code execution, although there can be corner cases.
If it is on the same host, you should definitely check for code execution possibilities.
Are you able to request the uploaded file back from the server?
If you can access the uploaded file, it will either get executed by the server or served to you as a download. Both cases can result in vulnerabilities,
see File Uploads Testing: Client-side Code Execution for additional info.
Does the web server support execution of script files?

Does the web server support execution of script files (.php, .py, .aspx, .jsp and so on) by accessing them via a URL? 

If the web server has a CGI handler configured for some extensions, you may be able to upload a web shell. Test this by uploading one of Synopsys-branded
web shells and accessing the uploaded file in your browser.

Currently available web shells:

    PHP Web Shell
    ASP.Net Web Shell
    ASP Classic Web Shell
    JSP Web Shell

If the file upload is rejected, remember to try the validation bypass tricks mentioned here.

You can also use the Upload Scanner extension in Burp Suite to test for this. See the File Uploads Testing: Tooling page for instructions on how to use it.

If you cannot upload, access or execute the web shell, there is no server-side code execution through file uploads.

If you have successfully uploaded a web shell, find out what privileges you get on the system and proceed to determining impact.
Reporting policy for web shell uploads
CVD: Remote Code Execution via File Upload
Example scenarios

Attacker can successfully upload a web shell or other file that leads to remote code execution on the server.
A web shell can be uploaded (no error), but cannot be accessed afterwards.
A web shell can be uploaded (no error), but is served as text/plain or is otherwise not executable.
The web shell gets root privileges, leading to full compromise of the system.
High likelihood if the attack does not require authentication (or users can easily self-register accounts to access the vulnerable upload).
Medium likelihood if the attack requires authentication.
The web shell gets limited privileges, leading to limited, but substantial compromise of the system.
High likelihood if the attack does not require authentication.
Medium likelihood if the attack requires authentication.
