RCE stands for Remote Code Execution. It refers to a security vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a target system remotely. 
Remote code execution vulnerabilities are considered highly severe because they enable attackers to take control of the system and potentially perform 
various malicious actions, such as installing malware, stealing data, or further compromising the system's security.

Remote code execution vulnerabilities typically occur due to insecure coding practices, software bugs, or improper input validation. Attackers exploit 
these vulnerabilities by sending specially crafted inputs or payloads to the target system, which the system processes unsafely, allowing the attacker 
to execute arbitrary code.

Common examples of vulnerabilities that can lead to remote code execution include:

Injection Vulnerabilities: This includes SQL injection, command injection, and other injection attacks where an attacker can inject malicious 
code into the target system.

Deserialization Vulnerabilities: Insecure deserialization of data inputs can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code by manipulating serialized objects or data.

File Upload Vulnerabilities: As mentioned earlier, insecure file upload functionality can lead to remote code execution if the uploaded files 
are executed on the server without proper validation.

Unpatched Software: Exploiting known vulnerabilities in software that has not been updated or patched can also lead to remote code execution.

Buffer Overflows and Memory Corruption: Bugs such as buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues in software can be exploited to execute arbitrary 
code on the target system.

Mitigating remote code execution vulnerabilities involves a combination of secure coding practices, regular software updates and patches, input validation, 
proper access controls, and implementing security mechanisms such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems. Additionally, security testing, including 
vulnerability scanning and penetration testing, can help identify and address potential remote code execution vulnerabilities in software applications and systems.


HTML CODE EXECUTION VIA FILE UPLOAD :::----

Executing HTML scripts via file uploads can be considered a vulnerability if the application doesn't properly validate and sanitize the uploaded files.
Here's how it could potentially be exploited:

Upload HTML file: The attacker uploads an HTML file containing malicious scripts (such as JavaScript) to the web application. The file could have a 
benign extension like .html or .txt to bypass basic file type checks.

Lack of Validation: The application fails to properly validate the uploaded file's content or MIME type, allowing the attacker to upload and store the file on the server.

User Interaction: The attacker convinces a victim to visit a page where the uploaded HTML file is located, either by sharing a direct link or embedding it
within a legitimate page on the application.

Script Execution: When the victim accesses the page containing the malicious HTML file, their browser executes the embedded scripts within the context of the 
application's domain. This could lead to various attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), where the attacker's scripts are executed in the victim's browser, 
potentially allowing the attacker to steal sensitive information, perform actions on behalf of the victim, or carry out other malicious activities.

To prevent this type of vulnerability, web applications should implement robust file upload security measures, including:

File Type Validation: Verify that uploaded files have allowed file types and reject files with potentially dangerous extensions like .html, .js, etc.
Content-Type Checking: Check the MIME type of uploaded files to ensure they match the expected type.
File Content Inspection: Scan uploaded files for potentially malicious content using antivirus software or content analysis tools.
File Storage: Store uploaded files outside the web root directory to prevent direct execution and limit access permissions to uploaded files.
Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement CSP headers to mitigate the impact of any successful XSS attacks by restricting the execution of inline 
scripts and enforcing strict content loading policies.By implementing these security measures, web applications can reduce the risk of HTML script 
execution vulnerabilities via file uploads and protect against potential exploitation by malicious actors.
